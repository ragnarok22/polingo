## Polingo Code of Conduct

The Polingo community is built on respect, empathy, and collaboration. This Code of Conduct explains what we expect from everyone who takes part in our projects and spaces—maintainers, contributors, users, sponsors, and event participants alike.

### Our Standards

**Positive behavior includes:**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Showing empathy and respect for differing opinions and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Assuming good intent while remaining mindful of impact.

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
- Derogatory or demeaning remarks, gestures, or jokes.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
- Sustained disruption of discussions, reviews, or other collaborative spaces.
- Encouraging or assisting any of the above.

### Scope

This policy applies across all Polingo channels, both online and in-person. That includes repositories, issue trackers, code reviews, chat platforms, community events, and private communications when representing the project.

### Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or have any concerns, please contact the maintainers at **conduct@polingo.dev**. If you are uncomfortable emailing that address, you may reach out privately to any maintainer through the contact methods listed in `README.md`.

Reports will be handled respectfully and as confidentially as possible. The maintainers commit to:
- Acknowledging receipt of the report within five business days.
- Reviewing the incident promptly, speaking with the parties involved when necessary.
- Determining appropriate actions, which may include warnings, mediated discussions, temporary or permanent bans, or other steps to protect the community.

### Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers must model the standards described here and address unacceptable behavior in any community space. Maintainers who do not enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions, including removal from the project team.

### Appeal

If you believe a decision was made in error, you may request a review by replying to the original notice within 14 days. The review will be handled by maintainers who were not directly involved in the original decision when possible.
